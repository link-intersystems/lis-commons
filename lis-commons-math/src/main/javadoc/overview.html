	<h2>Version Numbering</h2>
	<p>An API is the important contract between a client and a service.
		Therefore API changes must be tracked using version numbers. The
		version numbering must reflect the changes of the service and provide
		information about breaking API changes that might affect a client. The
		version numbering must ensure that every breaking API change is
		tracked.
	<p>We track API changes via a 4 digit version pattern with a
		qualifier segment.</p>
	<pre>
+- facade segment
| +- major segment
| | +- minor segment
| | | +- service segment

	<ul>
		<li><b>facade segment</b><br /> See the <a href="#facades">definition</a>
			of components that belong to a facade segment for details. If clients
			only use facades they will only be affected if the first version
			number (facade segement) changes. Change from version 1.2.4; to
			1.3.2.1 will not affect a client that only uses facades.</li>
		<li><b>major segment</b><br /> This version number segment is
			increased whenever a breaking api change occurs in one of the
			package's classes or interfaces that are <a href="#public_api">public
				api</a>. See <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs">Evolving
				Java-based APIs</a> for details on what constitutes a breaking change.</li>
		<li><b>minor segment</b><br /> This segment is defined equal to
			the definition of a minor segment in <a
			href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Version_Numbering">Version
				Numbering</a></li>
		<li><b>service segment</b><br /> This segment is defined equal
			to the definition of a service segment in <a
			href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Version_Numbering">Version
				Numbering</a>. In short: bug fixes that do not affect client code.</li>
		<li><b>qualifier segment</b><br /> The qualifier segment marks a
			version as a development version. That means that it is work in
			progress and the API might change unexpectedly. Therefore you should
			not implement against SNAPSHOT versions. The version number before
			the SNAPSHOT segment is the number that will be released when the
			development of that SNAPSHOT version is finished. Only use libraries
			with such a version if you want to integrate against the next
			release. These versions must not be used in production, because they
			can lead to unpredictable behavior, rebuild of your software might
			not work and therefore bugs might not be reproducible.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Packages</h2>
	<h3>Structure and naming</h3>
	<p>

		A package defines the boundary of classes and interfaces that belong
		together to fulfill some special purpose. In contrast to classes and
		interfaces a package is a coarse-grained perspective. A package can be
		named and therefore give a set of classes and interfaces a meaning.
		The name should always be chosen in order to increase the clarity of
		understanding of a system and should not give any technical or
		implementation hints. It's bad practice to separate interfaces from
		their implementation by putting them in sub-packages named
		<code>impl</code>
		. For details see
		<code>://www.link-intersystems.com
			/bin/view/Blog/Wise+separation+of+api+and+implementation</code>
		. <br> Packages might contain sub-packages. A sub-package should
		be seen as a
		<code>"is part of"</code>
		relationship. E.g if you have a package called
		<code>building</code>
		the
		<code>floor</code>
		package should be a sub package with the full qualified name
		<code>building.floor</code>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		Packages are named after the singular form of a substantive that
		describes the package. So a packages should be named
		<code>floor</code>
		instead of
		<code>floors</code>
		.
	</p>
	<h3 id="facades">Facades</h3>
	<p>
		A package might be a complex system that is hard to understand, to
		configure and to manage. Therefore a package can provide a high level
		abstraction of the common use cases that hides the complexity of
		interactions of it's classes from clients. E.g. a http protocol
		package might contain a get object a http connection manager, a proxy
		configuration, a content object and or transformer and so on. While
		these fine-grained components are useful for a good design,
		maintainability and professional users they are too complex for easy
		use cases like most clients are interested in. E.g.
		<code>String content = new
			URL("http://www.somesite.com").getContent();</code>
		. For those use cases the package should provide a facade that
		encapsulates the common use cases in an easy way. This facade should
		be named after the package and postfixed with
		<code>Facade</code>
		. E.g.
		<code>ReflectionFacade</code>
		. The facade must be an interface and it's implementation is available
		through the service provider specification as defined in the jar file
		specification (META-INF/services). For this purposes clients can use
		an instance of the
		<code>com.link_intersystems.lang.services.JarFileSpecificationServiceLocator</code>
		that implements the
		<code>com.link_intersystems.lang.services.ClassServiceLocator</code>
		interface. All facades must be stateless which means that the state of
		the facade must not be tied to a client's call history. Nevertheless a
		facade can act as a factory for objects that are stateful.
	</p>

	<h2>General API contracts</h2>
	<p>An API is the significant contract between a client and a
		service. Therefore API changes must be tracked using version numbers.
		The version numbering must reflect the changes of the service and
		provide information about breaking API changes that might affect a
		client. The version numbering must ensure that every breaking API
		change is tracked. To learn more about API and breaking API changes
		take a look at http://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs.</p>
	<h3>Invocation arguments contract</h3>
	Every defined parameter of an invokable object (method or constructor)
	must not be
	<code>null</code>
	.
	<br> If a method allows a parameter to be
	<code>null</code>
	it must be explicitly documented in the parameter's javadoc. Every
	method or constructor should only define parameters that it needs.
	Parameters that can be
	<code>null</code>
	confuse the client and make the implementation code harder to
	understand, because it must handle a lot more possible pre-conditions.
	If a parameter is optional the method or constructor should be
	overloaded to provide a clear API for the client and separate the
	different pre-condition constraint validations.
	<br> Here is an example of a clear API.

	<pre> public void doSomething(Range range){
        if(range == null){
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("range must not be null");
        }
  ...
 }
 </pre>

	The Range parameter object does enforces your API constraints.

	<pre> public class Range {

        private final int start;
        private final int end;

        public Range(int start, int end) {
                if (start &gt; end) {
                        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                                        "start must be less than end, but was " + start + " &gt;  "
                                                        + end);
                }
                this.end = end;
                this.start = start;
        }

        public boolean within(int value) {
                return start &lt;= value &amp;&amp; value &lt;= end;
        }

        public int getStart() {
                return start;
        }

        public int getEnd() {
                return end;
        }
 }
 </pre>
	<h3>Return values</h3>
	Every method that declares a return type must return an object of that
	type and never
	<code>null</code>
	. Methods that return a
	<a
		href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html?is-external=true"
		title="class or interface in java.util"><code>Collection</code></a>
	type must return an empty
	<a
		href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html?is-external=true"
		title="class or interface in java.util"><code>Collection</code></a>
	instead of
	<code>null</code>
	. If a method does not comply to this contract it must be documented in
	the method's javadoc. In some cases the returned object might be used
	by the client and in other situations it might not be used. If it is an
	expensive operation to construct the return object and the method can
	not know if it will ever by used, consider to return a
	<code>lazy proxy</code>
	or
	<a href="../../com/link_intersystems/lang/ref/Reference.html"
		title="interface in com.link_intersystems.lang.ref"><code>Reference</code></a>
	instead.
