/**
 * Represents a reference to an object. In contrast to the
 * {@link java.lang.ref.Reference} provided by standard java, this reference is
 * intended to be implemented by clients. Every time you need an indirect
 * reference to another object (lazy loading,etc.) a {@link Reference} is the
 * simplest way to implement this. The return value of {@link Reference#get()}
 * should never be cached by a client. Instead the client should call
 * {@link #get()} whenever it needs a referent and clients must be prepared to
 * handle referent changes.
