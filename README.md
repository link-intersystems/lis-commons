[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/link-intersystems/lis-commons/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/link-intersystems/lis-commons/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

A collection of reusable Java components.

Some time ago (in 2007) I started to aggregate reusable Java components that were not included in J2SE or that provide an easier api for common programming tasks in one library.
In 2011 I published the library on www.link-intersystems.com and a few weeks ago (Dec. 2014) I decided to migrate this library from svn to git and make it available under the apache license 2.0 on github.

Most of the components are the result of projects that I worked on.
