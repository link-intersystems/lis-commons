lis-commons
=============

Some time ago (in 2007) I started to aggregate reusable Java components that were not included in J2SE and/or apache commons or they provide an easier api for common programming tasks in one library.
In 2011 I published the library on www.link-intersystems.com and a few weeks ago (Dec. 2014) I decided to migrate this library from svn to git and make it available under the apache license 2.0 on github.

Some of the components are the result of projects that I worked on and some are rather academic.

All components come with unit tests and the complete library has a very high coverage (> 90%).

Future plans
------
I plan to migrate all components that I have until Feb. 2015 to github.
Afterwards I will update the components to support generics, cut dependencies between libraries
and make them available through a maven repository.
